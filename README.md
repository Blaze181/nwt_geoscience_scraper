# NWT Geoscience Scraper & Downloader

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to automate the extraction and downloading of assessment report metadata and files from the [NWT Geoscience Assessment Report Index](https://app.nwtgeoscience.ca/Searching/ReferenceSearch.aspx).  
Both scripts use Selenium for browser automation and are intended for research and data collection purposes.

---

## Contents

- `NWT-Geoscience-Scraper.py`: Scrapes metadata (e.g., reference, type, title, company, date, location, download link) from the assessment report index and saves it as JSON files.
- `NWT-Geoscience-Download.py`: Automates the downloading of assessment report files from the same index, supporting interactive selection of pages and rows.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (matching your Chrome version)
- Required Python packages:
  - selenium
  - beautifulsoup4 (for the scraper)
  - (Optional) tqdm or other progress tools for large-scale scraping

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

### 1. Scraping Metadata

**Script:** `NWT-Geoscience-Scraper.py`

- Launches a Chrome browser (headless by default).
- Navigates to the NWT Geoscience Assessment Report Index.
- Selects "Assessment Report" as the report type.
- Prompts you to enter the range of pages to scrape.
- Extracts table data for each report on the selected pages and saves each page's data as a separate JSON file in the `assessment_reports` folder.

**How to run:**

```bash
python NWT-Geoscience-Scraper.py
```

**Output:**  
- JSON files named `PAGE_.json` (one per page), each containing an array of report metadata.

---

### 2. Downloading Reports

**Script:** `NWT-Geoscience-Download.py`

- Launches a Chrome browser.
- Navigates to the same index and selects "Assessment Report".
- Allows you to choose between downloading specific pages/rows or all pages.
- Interactively asks which rows to download per page.
- Downloads report files to a `downloaded_reports` directory.

**How to run:**

```bash
python NWT-Geoscience-Download.py
```

**Output:**  
- Downloaded PDF or ZIP files (depending on the report) in `downloaded_reports/`.

## Notes & Tips

- Both scripts require user input for page ranges or download selection.
- Make sure ChromeDriver is installed and available in your PATH.
- For large-scale scraping or downloading, ensure a stable internet connection and sufficient storage.
- If errors occur, the scripts save the current page's HTML for debugging.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors related to ChromeDriver, ensure it matches your Chrome browser version.
- If downloads stall or time out, try re-running the script or adjusting your internet connection.
- For debugging, check the saved HTML files (`error_page.html`, `error.html`, etc.) generated by the scripts.
